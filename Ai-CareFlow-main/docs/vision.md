# AI CareFlow – Vision

## Field  
AI for Healthcare Innovation

## Core Problem  
Clinicians face extreme administrative burden due to documentation, repetitive note-writing, and EHR overload. This leads to burnout, time waste, and workflow inefficiency.

## Mission  
I want to reduce healthcare administrative burden by developing AI systems that automate documentation, streamline workflows, and support clinicians with safe, explainable, human-centered tools.

## Solution  
AI CareFlow will:
- Summarize patient visit information  
- Generate SOAP-style draft clinical notes  
- Suggest high-level workflow steps  
- Ensure safe, transparent interaction design  
- Use synthetic or public-domain data only  

## My Role (Pranu)  
- UX design  
- user needs analysis  
- workflow mapping  
- human-AI interaction research  
- documentation + publication writing  

## Technical Role  
- LLM integration  
- backend logic  
- system architecture  
- deployment
